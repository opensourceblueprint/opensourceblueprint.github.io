# Intro

This site builds on Bryan Johnson's Blueprint for living a longer and healthier life. It aims to be a living document that is updated as new information becomes available. It's hosted on GitHub and anyone is able to submit a pull request to make changes. Also, since it's on Git there is a built in change-log and all of the edits are transparent. The goal is to provide a deep dive on all the topics that Bryan covers in his Blueprint.
