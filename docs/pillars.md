## Goal Alignment

## Zeroism
Blueprints philosophy of Zeroism views entropy, or aging and deterioration, as the enemy and proposes an Autonomous Self as the path to combat it. This is achieved through a data-driven, closed-loop system where the body, aided by scientific evidence, takes decision-making authority over health and well-being. The Autonomous Self is empowered through regular measurements of the body's organs, dictating their needs for optimal health, while also removing self-destructive behaviors and decisions, such as poor eating habits. The goal is continuous improvement and a future of expansive possibilities, referred to as a "Zeroth Principle Future," which is about hitting unseen targets, much like the function of genius compared to talent.

## Self Destructive Behavior
The Blueprint aims to eliminate self-destructive behaviors, which are often the result of poor decision-making. By automating important functions of health and wellness, individuals can prevent behaviors that negatively impact their health. These could include unhealthy eating, lack of exercise, and more. The Blueprint philosophy encourages rebellion against addictive algorithms, corporate profiteering at our detriment, social norms encouraging bad behavior, and self-sabotage.
