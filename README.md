# Blueprint OS

BlueprintOS is an open-source project inspired by Bryan Johnson's Blueprint. This project aims to help individuals build their Autonomous Self by optimizing health and wellness through data-driven decision-making.

This repository contains the core algorithm and utilities that power BlueprintOS. These tools allow users to measure, analyze, and track various health metrics, thereby enabling them to make more informed decisions about their lifestyle, diet, and other factors that affect their health and well-being.

## Philosophy
The philosophy of BlueprintOS aligns with that of the original Blueprint: Zeroism. The enemy is entropy, and the path is Goal Alignment via building your Autonomous Self. This system aims to combat entropy by maintaining perpetual youth and maximally slowing the pace of aging. It's done by empowering your body with decision authority in a closed loop system with scientific evidence and data. For more information, please visit the Blueprint website.
